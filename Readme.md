# C# for Nigerian course


Basics
- variables
- if/ for loops/while loops
- reading console + console write
Ex: Fizz buzz, Checkout

- More on strings
String format, substring, find in string

- arrays, lists and dictionary, string.join, foreach
Ex: Phonebook


Classes:
- Classes as data storage, fields and properties
Ex: create a class, checkout add classes

- classes as functionality (methods & how write methods (method syntax) classes, instance variables, static keywords)
Ex: counter, phonebook with classes, Dictionary assignment

- Generics
Ex: Dictionary assignment


## Proposed structure
### Grouping 1: Basics
- Hello world (Installation, Everyone setup)
- Go through different data types: and make sure everyone is comfortable with them (string, char
- If, for/while loops
- Reading and writing to the console (Console.Readline, Console.Writeline)
- Variable declaration syntax `var [name] = type`. This is the basic types. We'll explain the new keyword in grouping 
Ex: fizzbuzz

### Grouping 2: Strings
- String format `$"{var1} - {var2}"`
- Char/string difference
- Substring
- Find/Replace in string
Ex: Quiz game

Lesson 1: 
- Lesson 2: Go through if statements, for loops. Fizzbuzz assignment
- Lesson 3: Play with strings: Using console.readline, write line. Can make a quiz game
- Lesson 4: Explain classes: Class is a contract. Instance. Basic counter class
- Lesson 5: Access modifiers and fields
- Lesson 6: Instance methods: How to write a method, the method signature
- Lesson 7: The difference between fields, variables in methods and parameters
- Lesson 8: static methods and fields
- Lesson 9: Properties and constructors
- Lesson 9.5: The single responsiblity principle
- Lesson 10: Putting it all together: Ex on creating own class: This looks good: https://education.launchcode.org/csharp-web-development/chapters/classes/studio.html
- Lesson 11: Lists and arrays
- Lesson 12: Dictionaries
- Lesson 13: Debugging
- Lesson 14: Putting it all together: Phonebook
