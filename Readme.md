# C# for Nigerian course

## Proposed structure
### Grouping 1: Basics
- Hello world (Installation, Everyone setup)
- Go through different data types: and make sure everyone is comfortable with them (string, char, 
- If, for/while loops
- Reading and writing to the console (Console.Readline, Console.Writeline)
- Variable declaration syntax `type/var [name] = type`. This is the basic types. We'll explain the new keyword in grouping 

**Ex:** fizzbuzz, Bart Simpson's lines - looping

### Grouping 2: Strings
- String format `$"{var1} - {var2}"`
- Char/string difference `"" vs ''`. Char represents 1 character. String is a collection of characters
- Substring
- Find/Replace in string

**Ex:** Quiz game, Checkout (minus class bit), Rock paper scissors game

### Grouping 3: Collections
- Arrays `int[] arr = new [] { 1, 2, 3, 4 }`
- How array stored in memory: https://qr.ae/pvCsPV
- Lists
- Dictionary
- foreach
- string.Join() method  
- Array of arrays

**Ex:** Create Dictionary, Phonebook, Luhn algorithm: https://exercism.org/tracks/python/exercises/luhn

### Grouping 4: Programmer skills
- Debugging in Visual Studio
- Git & Github

**Ex:** Debug and fix broken code, Create git account and commit to it. From now on submiting all assignments on github

### Grouping 5: Classes as Data storage
- Classes with just fields and properties. No methods
- Fields and properties. Difference between them
- Syntax for fields, syntax for properties
- Setting properties and fields from constructor
- Access modifiers (private, protected, internal, public)
- `new` keyword: `var obj = new [Type]()`

**Ex:** create a class, checkout add classes to store product (and weight)


### Grouping 6: Classes as Functionality
https://education.launchcode.org/intro-to-programming-csharp/chapters/classes/index.html
- Constructors
- `this` keyword
- Static method on a class: How to write a method, the method signature
- Instance method on a class: How to write a method, the method signature
- Calling methods on a class

**Ex:** Counter class, Budget tracker, Design Restaurant Menu [link](https://education.launchcode.org/csharp-web-development/chapters/classes/studio.html)

### Grouping 8: Object-Orientated concepts
- Interfaces
- Inheritance (https://education.launchcode.org/intro-to-programming-csharp/chapters/inheritance/index.html)
- Encapsulation
- Single Responsiblity principle (https://education.launchcode.org/intro-to-programming-csharp/chapters/classes/srp.html)

**Ex:** [Launch Code Ex on inheritance](https://education.launchcode.org/intro-to-programming-csharp/chapters/inheritance/exercises.html), Refactor phonebook so now use classes


### Grouping 9: More on methods
https://education.launchcode.org/intro-to-programming-csharp/chapters/classes-part2/instance-and-static-methods.html#check-your-understanding
- Fields, local variables
- Return types
- Accessing static vs instance fields

**Ex:**
